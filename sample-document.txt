    This platform allows users to create specialized AI chatbots that can:
    - Analyze uploaded documents (PDF, images, text files)
    - Use document content as context for responses
    - Provide specialized knowledge based on uploaded materials
    - Maintain conversation memory and personality
    
    Key Features:
    - File Upload: PDF, images, text files
    - OCR Processing: Extract text from images
    - RAG System: Retrieve relevant document chunks
    - Context Integration: Use documents in AI responses
    - Personality Enforcement: Stay within defined expertise
    
    The system uses a RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) approach where:
    1. Documents are chunked into smaller pieces
    2. Each chunk is embedded using Google's embedding model
    3. Relevant chunks are retrieved based on user queries
    4. Retrieved context is included in AI responses
